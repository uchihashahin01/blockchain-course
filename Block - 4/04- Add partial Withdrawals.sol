/*
Run the Smart Contract
To understand what's going on here:
When someone withdraws funds, we check if the amount he wants to withdraw is smaller or equal than the amount he previously deposited. If yes, then we deduct the amount from his balance and send out the funds.


Deposit and Withdraw 50%
We will deposit 1 Ether from Account#1 and Withdraw 50% to Account#3. I won't provide Screenshots for the first few steps, since it's exactly the same as previously:
select Account#1 from the Accounts Dropdown
Value: 1 Ether
Hit the "sendMoney" button
Select Account#3 from the Accounts Dropdown
Copy the Address And Paste it in the "withdrawMoney" Input field
Add "500000000000000000" as amount
Switch back to Account#1 and hit the "withdrawMoney" button.
Check the Balance of "Account#3"
