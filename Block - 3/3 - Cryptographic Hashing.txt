Cryptographic Hashing


  





In the given example, the text "Hello Rome" is being passed through a hash function, which generates a corresponding hash or digest value. The resulting hash value is represented as a hexadecimal string:


"398bdaf31f6f516d28282a50d29e5a015fbdf13dea00c3fa75e449762e732414"


Here's what is happening:


Input Data: The input data is the string "Hello Rome". This could be any sequence of characters or data.


Hash Function: The input data is processed through a hash function. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input and produces a fixed-size output (digest). In this case, the specific hash function is not mentioned, but it is presumed to be a cryptographic hash function.


Hash Value: The hash function processes the input data and generates a unique hash value. The hash value is a string of characters that represents the result of the hashing process. It is typically represented in hexadecimal format, as shown in the example.


Hash Representation: The resulting hash value is the representation of the input data after being transformed by the hash function. The hash value is a fixed-length string, regardless of the length of the input data. It is important to note that even a small change in the input data will result in a significantly different hash value.
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  



In the given example, a slightly different input is being passed through the same hash function compared to the previous example:


Input: "Hello Rome!"


Hash Value: "d2b3c5d9298f751f5508810236868f1d4179d934261a95b0f905a51fe994e493"


The difference between this hash value and the previous one lies in the input data, specifically the addition of an exclamation mark at the end of the string.


Hash functions are designed to produce significantly different outputs for even small changes in the input. In this case, adding the exclamation mark alters the input, resulting in a completely different hash value.


While the two input strings "Hello Rome" and "Hello Rome!" are similar, their hash values are entirely distinct due to the nature of the hash function. Hash functions are intended to generate unique and non-reversible outputs, making it difficult to deduce the original input based solely on the hash value.


The difference between the two hash values highlights the property of hash functions called the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input leads to a significant change in the resulting hash value. This property is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of data when using hash functions in various applications such as data integrity checks, password storage, and digital signatures.

What is Digest:


In the context of cryptographic hashing, a digest refers to the fixed-length output generated by applying a cryptographic hash function to a given input. A cryptographic hash function takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size output, which is the digest.


The digest is also commonly referred to as the hash value, hash code, or hash sum. It is essentially a unique digital fingerprint of the input data. Even a slight change in the input will result in a significantly different digest.


The properties of a good cryptographic hash function ensure that the digest has the following characteristics:


Deterministic: For the same input, the hash function will always produce the same digest.


Preimage Resistance: Given the digest, it is computationally infeasible to determine the original input data.


Collision Resistance: It is extremely unlikely that two different inputs will produce the same digest.


Fixed Length: The digest has a fixed size, regardless of the size of the input data.


—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  



1. Deterministic: The property of being deterministic means that for a given input message, the hash function will always produce the same hash value. This property ensures consistency, as it allows users to verify the integrity of a message by recalculating the hash and comparing it with the original hash value.


2. Quick Computation: The ideal hash function should be computationally efficient, meaning it can quickly generate the hash value for any given message. Quick computation is important for practical use cases, especially when processing large volumes of data or in time-sensitive applications.


3. Infeasible to Reverse: An ideal hash function should make it practically infeasible to generate the original message from its hash value. This property ensures the security of the hash function by preventing someone from obtaining the original data through the hash value alone. The only way to determine the original message is by trying all possible messages and calculating their hash values, which should be computationally infeasible.


4. Small Changes Lead to Extensive Changes: This property, known as the avalanche effect, ensures that even a minor alteration to the input message will result in a significantly different hash value. A small change in the message should produce a hash value that appears uncorrelated to the original hash value. This property is vital for data integrity, as it ensures that even slight modifications to a message will result in distinct hash values.


5. Collision Resistance: An ideal hash function should make it extremely unlikely to find two different messages that produce the same hash value. This property is called collision resistance. It ensures that it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs with identical hash values, providing a level of security against intentional or accidental collisions
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When comparing hash functions like MD5, SHA256, and Keccak256, it's important to consider their collision resistance, security, and computational properties:


MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):
MD5 is an older hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. While it was widely used in the past, it is now considered to be weak in terms of collision resistance. Attacks on MD5 have been developed that can find collisions relatively easily, making it unsuitable for most security applications.


SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit):
SHA256 is part of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family of hash functions. It produces a 256-bit hash value and is widely used in various cryptographic applications. SHA256 is considered to be significantly more secure than MD5 and offers strong collision resistance. It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same SHA256 hash value. Consequently, SHA256 is widely adopted and recommended for many security-critical applications.


Keccak256:
Keccak256 is based on the Keccak sponge construction and is part of the SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) family of hash functions. Like SHA256, Keccak256 also produces a 256-bit hash value. Keccak256 is known for its strong security properties and is considered secure against known attacks. It is designed to offer resistance to various cryptographic attacks, including collision attacks.


In terms of security, both SHA256 and Keccak256 are considered to be strong hash functions. However, SHA256 has been more widely adopted and extensively studied, while Keccak256 is relatively newer but has gained popularity due to its selection as the winner of the NIST hash function competition.


In practice, SHA256 is commonly used in blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for its proven security and widespread support. It provides a balance between security and computational efficiency. Keccak256, on the other hand, is utilized in newer blockchain networks, such as Ethereum 2.0, where it is used as the hashing algorithm for various operations.

Hashing of Hashes


  

When we mix abc and cde we get a new hash, simply adding 123 will also change the hash.
  



—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blockchain Hashing


  



In a blockchain, blocks are containers that store data, such as transactions, in a chronological order. Each block contains a header that includes various pieces of information, including the previous block's hash value.


When a new block is created, its header is hashed using the chosen hash function (e.g., SHA256), generating a unique hash value. This hash value serves as the digital fingerprint of the block and is commonly referred to as the block's "hash."


By including the previous block's hash in the current block's header, a chain-like structure is created, forming the blockchain. This chaining mechanism ensures the immutability of the blockchain, as any modification to a previous block would change its hash value, which would then propagate through subsequent blocks.

Blockchain Hashing + Decentralization


  



Hashing allows participants in the blockchain network to verify the integrity of the data without needing to access or verify the entire contents of each block. By comparing the hash values of blocks, participants can quickly determine if the data has been tampered with or if there are any inconsistencies.


Additionally, hashing provides a layer of security by ensuring that sensitive data, such as transaction details or personal information, remains confidential. Instead of storing the actual data in the blockchain, only the hash values are stored, protecting the privacy of participants.
