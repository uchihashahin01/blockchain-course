/*
In this project, you are going to implement a simple messenger functionality in a Smart Contract.
Through the constructor make sure you write the address that deployed the contract to a variable
Create a message-variable of the type string, that only the deployer-address can update
Create a counter, to see how many times the variable was updated.
