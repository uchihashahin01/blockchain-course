Contract
We're going to expand our Smart Contract from before and add a function to write!

//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.20;

contract MyContract {
    string public myString = "Hello world";

    function updateOurString(string memory _myString) public {
        myString = _myString;
    }
}


Interaction
If you deploy the Smart Contract to the JavaScript VM, you'll see that a new button appeared in a different color:
 
When you enter
1. "Hello Earth" in the input field and
2. send off the transaction, then
3. a new Transaction will appear in the log windows and
4. The string "myString" is updated to "Hello Earth"
