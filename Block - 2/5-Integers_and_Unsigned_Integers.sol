/*Rounding with Integers
Integers in Solidity are always rounded down! If we divide e.g. 100 / 101 = 0.990... but in Solidity the result will be 0. Integers in Solidity are actually cut off (not even rounded), in other words always rounded down.*/


/*In case you don't know what exactly integers are, then let's define first what we're talking about:
An integer is [...] a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, ... is not. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer
Integral types may be unsigned (capable of representing only non-negative integers) or signed (capable of representing negative integers as well) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)
In layman's terms: Integers are numbers without decimals. Unsigned integers cannot be negative.
In Solidity there are several integers sizes available, which mostly influence the amount of gas used to store a value.
The smallest one is (u)int8 (0 to 2^8-1, or 0 to 255), the biggest one is uint256 (0 to 2^256 - 1, or 0 to a "very large number" 🤔)
Let's define a simpleSmart Contract first so we can set an integer and then read the value again.
